#Challenge Description:
#Create a Python program that defines three variables:
#
#An integer (e.g., your age).
#
#A float (e.g., your height in meters).
#
#A string (e.g., your favorite color).
#
#Then, print them all out in a single sentence.
#
#Input Example
#(No user input; you define the values in code.)
#
#Expected Output
#My age is 25, my height is 1.75 meters, and my favorite color is blue.

AGE = 25
HEIGHT = 1.75
COLOR = "Blue"

print(f"My age is {AGE}, my height is {HEIGHT} meters, and my favorite color is {COLOR}.")
