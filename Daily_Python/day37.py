""" Retry Decorator with Exponential Backoff

Difficulty: Intermediate

Challenge Description: Implement a decorator @retry that retries a function call when it raises a specified exception. Parameters:

exceptions: a single Exception type or tuple of types to catch (default: Exception)

max_attempts: int > 0 (default: 3)

base_delay: float seconds for the first delay (default: 0.1)

factor: multiplier applied to the delay after each failure (default: 2.0)

jitter: optional float added/subtracted uniformly at random in [-jitter, +jitter] to each delay (default: 0.0)
Behavior:

On failure, sleep for delay seconds, then retry. Delay grows as base_delay * (factor ** (attempt - 1)), plus jitter if provided.

If all attempts fail, re-raise the last exception.

Preserve the wrapped functionâ€™s name and doc.
